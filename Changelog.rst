Changes from `0.9x` series API
--------------------------------

- `ParallelSSHClient.join` no longer consumes output buffers
- Command output is now a dictionary of host name -> `host output object <http://parallel-ssh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html>`_ with `stdout` and et al attributes. Host output supports dictionary-like item lookup for backwards compatibility. No code changes are needed to output use though documentation will from now on refer to the new attribute style output. Dictionary-like item access is deprecated and will be removed in future major release, like `2.x`.
- Made output encoding configurable via keyword argument on `run_command` and `get_output`
- `pssh.output.HostOutput` class added to hold host output
- Added `copy_remote_file` function for copying remote files to local ones in parallel
- Deprecated since `0.70.0` `ParallelSSHClient` API endpoints removed
- Removed setuptools >= 28.0.0 dependency for better compatibility with existing installations. Pip version dependency remains for Py 2.6 compatibility with gevent - documented on project's readme
- Documented `use_pty` parameter of run_command
- `SSHClient` `read_output_buffer` is now public function and has gained callback capability
- If using the single `SSHClient` directly, `read_output_buffer` should now be used to read output buffers - this is not needed for `ParallelSSHClient`
- `run_command` now uses named positional and keyword arguments
